AgentRunResult(output='### Web UI Layer Documentation for Application/Sale Aggregate\n\n#### Overview\nThe Web UI layer serves as the interface between users and the underlying application logic encapsulated within the Application/Sale aggregate. This layer typically consists of controllers, views, and API endpoints that facilitate user interactions and data presentation.\n\n#### Controllers\nControllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing user input, and returning appropriate responses. For the Application/Sale aggregate, the following controllers would typically be present:\n\n1. **SaleController**: \n   - **Responsibilities**: Manage the lifecycle of sales, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.\n   - **Endpoints**:\n     - `GET /sales`: Retrieve a list of all sales.\n     - `GET /sales/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific sale.\n     - `POST /sales`: Create a new sale.\n     - `PUT /sales/{id}`: Update an existing sale.\n     - `DELETE /sales/{id}`: Remove a sale from the system.\n\n2. **SaleItemController** (if applicable):\n   - **Responsibilities**: Manage individual items within a sale.\n   - **Endpoints**:\n     - `GET /sales/{saleId}/items`: List items for a specific sale.\n     - `POST /sales/{saleId}/items`: Add an item to a sale.\n     - `DELETE /sales/{saleId}/items/{itemId}`: Remove an item from a sale.\n\n#### Views\nViews are the presentation layer that renders the data returned by the controllers. They are typically implemented using a templating engine or front-end framework. For the Application/Sale aggregate, the following views would be expected:\n\n1. **Sale List View**:\n   - Displays a list of all sales with options to view, edit, or delete each sale.\n   - Includes pagination and search functionality for better usability.\n\n2. **Sale Detail View**:\n   - Shows detailed information about a specific sale, including associated items, total amounts, and customer details.\n   - Provides options to edit or delete the sale.\n\n3. **Sale Creation/Editing View**:\n   - A form for creating a new sale or editing an existing one.\n   - Includes fields for entering sale details, adding items, and calculating totals.\n\n4. **Sale Item View** (if applicable):\n   - Displays individual items within a sale, allowing for item-specific actions such as editing or deleting.\n\n#### API Endpoints\nIn addition to traditional web views, the Application/Sale aggregate may expose RESTful API endpoints for integration with other services or front-end applications. The API endpoints would mirror the controller actions, allowing for CRUD operations on sales and their items.\n\n#### User Interfaces\nThe user interface should be designed with usability in mind, ensuring that users can easily navigate through sales, view details, and perform actions without confusion. Key aspects include:\n\n- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the UI is accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n- **User Feedback**: Implement notifications or alerts to inform users of successful actions (e.g., sale creation) or errors (e.g., validation failures).\n- **Accessibility**: Adhere to accessibility standards to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with the application.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Web UI layer for the Application/Sale aggregate is crucial for providing a seamless user experience. It encompasses controllers for handling requests, views for rendering data, and API endpoints for integration. Proper design and implementation of this layer enhance user engagement and operational efficiency.')
