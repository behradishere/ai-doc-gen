AgentRunResult(output="### Infrastructure Layer Documentation for Application/Sale Aggregate\n\n#### Overview\nThe infrastructure layer is a critical component of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, serving as the bridge between the domain model and external systems. It typically includes repositories for data access, integrations with external services, and any necessary configurations for persistence and communication.\n\n#### Repositories\nIn the context of the Application/Sale aggregate, the repository pattern is employed to encapsulate data access logic. The repository should provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Sale entities. This allows the domain layer to remain agnostic of the underlying data storage mechanism.\n\n1. **SaleRepository**: \n   - **Interface**: Defines methods such as `Add(Sale sale)`, `GetById(Guid id)`, `GetAll()`, and `Update(Sale sale)`.\n   - **Implementation**: The concrete class (e.g., `SaleRepository`) implements the interface using an ORM (like Entity Framework) or direct SQL queries to interact with the database. It handles the mapping between the Sale aggregate and the database schema.\n\n2. **Unit of Work**: \n   - If applicable, a Unit of Work pattern can be implemented to manage transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring that all operations are completed successfully before committing changes to the database.\n\n#### External Service Integrations\nThe infrastructure layer may also include integrations with external services that the Sale aggregate relies on. This could involve:\n\n1. **Payment Gateway Integration**: \n   - A service that handles payment processing. The infrastructure layer would include a `PaymentService` that encapsulates the logic for interacting with the payment provider's API, including methods for processing payments, handling refunds, and querying payment statuses.\n\n2. **Email Notification Service**: \n   - If the application sends confirmation emails or notifications upon sale completion, an `EmailService` can be implemented. This service would handle the communication with an external email service provider (like SendGrid or SMTP servers).\n\n3. **Inventory Management**: \n   - If the Sale aggregate interacts with an inventory system, an `InventoryService` could be included to check stock levels, reserve items, or update inventory counts post-sale.\n\n#### Data Access\nData access in the infrastructure layer typically involves:\n\n1. **Entity Framework or Dapper**: \n   - Depending on the complexity and performance requirements, Entity Framework (EF) or Dapper may be used for data access. EF provides a rich ORM experience with change tracking and lazy loading, while Dapper offers a lightweight and performant alternative for executing SQL queries.\n\n2. **Database Context**: \n   - A `DbContext` class (if using EF) that manages the entity objects during runtime, including tracking changes and persisting data to the database.\n\n3. **Connection Strings and Configuration**: \n   - Configuration settings for database connections, including connection strings, should be managed through a configuration file (like `appsettings.json`) or environment variables to maintain security and flexibility.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe infrastructure layer for the Application/Sale aggregate is essential for ensuring that the domain model can interact with external systems and persist data effectively. By implementing repositories, external service integrations, and robust data access strategies, this layer supports the overall architecture and functionality of the application. If the infrastructure layer is not currently implemented, it is crucial to establish these components to facilitate a clean separation of concerns and maintainability within the application.")
