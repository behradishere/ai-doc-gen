AgentRunResult(output="### Changelog for Application/Sale Aggregate\n\n#### Version History\n\n**Version 1.0.0** - Initial Release  \n- Introduced the `Sale` aggregate to manage sales transactions.\n- Implemented core properties: `SaleId`, `CustomerId`, `ProductId`, `Quantity`, `TotalPrice`, and `SaleDate`.\n- Added methods for creating a sale and calculating total price based on quantity and product price.\n\n**Version 1.1.0** - Enhancements  \n- Added validation for `Quantity` to ensure it is greater than zero.\n- Introduced event sourcing for sale creation, allowing for better tracking of changes.\n- Added `SaleStatus` property to manage the state of the sale (e.g., Pending, Completed, Canceled).\n\n**Version 1.2.0** - Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements  \n- Fixed a bug where `TotalPrice` was not recalculated when the product price changed.\n- Optimized the aggregate's methods for better performance during high transaction volumes.\n- Updated documentation for methods to clarify usage and expected behaviors.\n\n**Version 1.3.0** - New Features  \n- Implemented support for discounts on sales, allowing for a `Discount` property.\n- Added a method to apply a discount to the total price.\n- Enhanced event logging to include discount details.\n\n**Version 1.4.0** - Refactoring and Code Cleanup  \n- Refactored the aggregate to follow SOLID principles more closely.\n- Separated concerns by introducing a `SaleService` for business logic.\n- Improved unit tests for better coverage and reliability.\n\n#### Notable Updates\n- The introduction of event sourcing has significantly improved the ability to audit sales transactions.\n- The addition of discount handling has made the aggregate more flexible for various sales scenarios.\n- Ongoing performance improvements have ensured that the aggregate can handle increased loads without degradation.\n\n### Documentation on Changes and Evolution\n\nThe `Sale` aggregate within the Application layer of the Daya_Backend project has undergone significant evolution since its initial release. The aggregate was designed to encapsulate all the necessary attributes and behaviors associated with sales transactions, ensuring that the business logic remains cohesive and maintainable.\n\nIn its initial version (1.0.0), the `Sale` aggregate provided a basic structure with essential properties and methods to create a sale and calculate the total price. This foundational work laid the groundwork for future enhancements.\n\nWith version 1.1.0, the aggregate saw the introduction of validation and event sourcing. The validation of `Quantity` ensured that only valid sales could be processed, while event sourcing allowed for a robust mechanism to track changes over time, which is crucial for auditing and debugging.\n\nVersion 1.2.0 focused on addressing bugs and optimizing performance. The recalculation of `TotalPrice` when product prices changed was a critical fix, ensuring that the aggregate remained accurate. Performance optimizations were also vital, especially as the application began to scale.\n\nThe introduction of discounts in version 1.3.0 marked a significant feature enhancement, allowing the aggregate to cater to more complex sales scenarios. This flexibility is essential for modern applications that often require dynamic pricing strategies.\n\nFinally, version 1.4.0 emphasized code quality and maintainability through refactoring. By adhering to SOLID principles and separating concerns, the aggregate became easier to test and extend, ensuring that future developers can build upon it effectively.\n\nOverall, the evolution of the `Sale` aggregate reflects a commitment to continuous improvement, ensuring that it meets the needs of the business while maintaining high standards of code quality and performance. Future updates will likely focus on further enhancing functionality, improving user experience, and integrating with other aggregates and services within the domain.")
