AgentRunResult(output='### Application Layer Documentation for Aggregate: Application/Sale\n\nThe Application Layer is a crucial part of the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, serving as a bridge between the domain model and the external world. In the context of the `Application/Sale` aggregate, this layer is responsible for orchestrating operations related to sales, managing the flow of data, and ensuring that business rules are adhered to.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Application Layer\n\n1. **Application Services**:\n   - Application services encapsulate the business logic that coordinates operations across multiple domain entities and aggregates. For the `Sale` aggregate, an application service might handle operations such as creating a new sale, updating sale details, or processing payments.\n   - These services are stateless and typically expose methods that correspond to use cases, such as `CreateSale`, `UpdateSale`, and `CancelSale`.\n\n2. **Command Handlers**:\n   - Command handlers are responsible for processing commands that represent requests to change the state of the system. Each command corresponds to a specific action within the application.\n   - For the `Sale` aggregate, command handlers would handle commands like `CreateSaleCommand`, `UpdateSaleCommand`, and `CancelSaleCommand`. Each handler would validate the command, invoke the appropriate application service, and manage the transaction boundaries.\n   - Command handlers ensure that business rules are enforced and that the commands are executed in a consistent manner.\n\n3. **Query Handlers**:\n   - Query handlers are responsible for retrieving data from the system without modifying its state. They respond to queries that request information about sales, such as `GetSaleByIdQuery` or `GetSalesByCustomerQuery`.\n   - These handlers typically return data in the form of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), which are tailored representations of the data required by the client, ensuring that only the necessary information is exposed.\n\n4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:\n   - DTOs are simple objects that carry data between processes. They are used to transfer data from the application layer to the presentation layer or external systems.\n   - For the `Sale` aggregate, DTOs might include `SaleDTO`, `SaleSummaryDTO`, and `SaleDetailDTO`. These DTOs would encapsulate the relevant properties of a sale, such as sale ID, customer information, item details, and total amount, while abstracting away the underlying domain model complexities.\n\n#### Typical Components of the Application Layer\n\nIf the application layer does not currently exist for the `Sale` aggregate, it should ideally include the following components:\n\n- **Application Services**: Classes that define methods for executing business use cases related to sales.\n- **Command Handlers**: Classes that handle commands, ensuring that the necessary validations and business rules are applied.\n- **Query Handlers**: Classes that handle queries, retrieving data and returning it in a structured format.\n- **DTOs**: Classes that represent the data structure for transferring information between layers.\n\nIn summary, the application layer for the `Sale` aggregate plays a vital role in managing the interactions between the domain model and external clients, ensuring that all operations are executed according to the defined business rules while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.')
