AgentRunResult(output='### Web UI Layer Documentation for Aggregate: Application/ssrs\n\n#### Overview\nThe Web UI layer serves as the interface between users and the underlying application logic encapsulated within the SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) aggregate. It typically includes controllers, views, and API endpoints that facilitate user interaction and data presentation.\n\n#### Controllers\nControllers in the Web UI layer are responsible for handling incoming requests, processing user input, and returning appropriate responses. For the SSRS aggregate, the following controllers may be present:\n\n- **ReportController**: Manages the lifecycle of reports, including actions such as creating, viewing, and deleting reports. It interacts with the application service layer to perform operations and returns views or JSON responses.\n  \n- **DashboardController**: Provides an interface for users to view dashboards that aggregate various reports. It may include methods for filtering and sorting data based on user preferences.\n\n- **UserController**: Handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific reports or dashboards.\n\n#### Views\nViews are responsible for rendering the user interface. They are typically built using a templating engine (e.g., Razor in ASP.NET MVC) and may include:\n\n- **Report Views**: Display individual reports, including charts, tables, and other visual elements. Users can interact with these views to export data, print reports, or apply filters.\n\n- **Dashboard Views**: Present a consolidated view of multiple reports, allowing users to see key metrics at a glance. These views may include widgets that can be customized by the user.\n\n- **User Interface Elements**: Common UI components such as navigation menus, buttons, and forms for user input (e.g., report parameters) are essential for enhancing user experience.\n\n#### API Endpoints\nThe Web UI layer may expose RESTful API endpoints to facilitate interactions with the SSRS aggregate. These endpoints can be consumed by client-side applications or third-party services. Typical API endpoints might include:\n\n- **GET /api/reports**: Retrieves a list of available reports.\n- **POST /api/reports**: Creates a new report based on provided data.\n- **GET /api/reports/{id}**: Fetches details of a specific report.\n- **DELETE /api/reports/{id}**: Deletes a specified report.\n- **GET /api/dashboards**: Retrieves dashboard data for the user.\n\n#### User Interfaces\nThe user interface should be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. Key aspects include:\n\n- **Navigation**: Clear and consistent navigation to allow users to easily access reports and dashboards.\n- **Search and Filter Options**: Users should be able to search for specific reports and apply filters to narrow down results.\n- **Data Visualization**: Use of charts, graphs, and tables to present data in an easily digestible format.\n- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the UI is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Web UI layer for the SSRS aggregate is crucial for providing users with an effective means to interact with reporting functionalities. By implementing well-structured controllers, engaging views, and robust API endpoints, the Web UI can enhance user experience and streamline reporting processes. If the Web UI layer is not currently implemented, it is essential to consider these components for future development to ensure a comprehensive and user-friendly interface.')
