The aggregate was first introduced to facilitate the management of reports within the application, providing essential CRUD functionalities. Over time, the focus shifted towards enhancing user experience and security, leading to significant updates in user permissions and export capabilities.\n\nIn version 1.1.0, filtering capabilities were added, allowing users to retrieve reports based on specific criteria, which greatly improved the usability of the aggregate. This was complemented by performance optimizations in subsequent versions, ensuring that reports could be generated and accessed quickly, even under high load conditions.\n\nThe major refactor in version 1.4.0 marked a pivotal moment in the aggregate's development, as it aligned more closely with Domain-Driven Design principles. This refactor not only improved the codebase but also introduced domain services that encapsulated business logic related to report processing. This separation of concerns enhanced maintainability and testability, allowing for more robust unit tests to be implemented.\n\nSecurity became a primary focus in version 1.5.0, where OAuth2 authentication was introduced to safeguard user access. Additionally, data encryption was implemented to protect sensitive information within reports, addressing potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\n\nOverall, the SSRS aggregate has evolved significantly, with each version building upon the last to enhance functionality, performance, and security. The changelog serves as a historical record of these changes, providing insights into the aggregate's development journey and guiding future enhancements.")
