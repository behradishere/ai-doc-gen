AgentRunResult(output='### Domain Layer Analysis for Aggregate: Application/ssrs\n\n#### Overview\nThe domain layer is a critical component of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), encapsulating the business logic and rules of the application. It typically consists of entities, value objects, domain services, and aggregates that represent the core of the business domain. In the context of the `Application/ssrs` aggregate, we will analyze the potential components that would typically be found in this layer.\n\n#### Entities\nEntities are objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. In the context of the `ssrs` aggregate, possible entities could include:\n\n1. **Report**: Represents an individual report generated by the system. It would have properties such as `ReportId`, `Title`, `Content`, and `CreatedDate`. The identity of a report is crucial for tracking and managing its lifecycle.\n\n2. **User**: Represents a user who can create or access reports. It would contain properties like `UserId`, `Username`, and `Email`. The User entity may also have relationships with reports, indicating which user created or owns which reports.\n\n#### Value Objects\nValue objects are immutable and defined only by their attributes. They do not possess a unique identity. In the `ssrs` aggregate, the following value objects might be present:\n\n1. **ReportContent**: This could encapsulate the content of a report, including its format (e.g., PDF, Excel) and any metadata. It would be immutable once created.\n\n2. **ReportMetadata**: This might include attributes like `CreatedBy`, `CreatedDate`, and `LastModifiedDate`, providing context about the report without being an entity itself.\n\n#### Domain Services\nDomain services encapsulate domain logic that does not naturally fit within an entity or value object. They are stateless and can be reused across different aggregates. In the `ssrs` aggregate, a potential domain service could be:\n\n1. **ReportGenerationService**: This service could handle the logic for generating reports, including validating input data, applying business rules, and coordinating the creation of report entities.\n\n#### Business Rules\nBusiness rules define the constraints and policies governing the behavior of the domain. In the `ssrs` aggregate, some potential business rules could include:\n\n1. **Report Creation Rule**: A user must have the appropriate permissions to create a report. This could involve checking user roles or access levels.\n\n2. **Report Modification Rule**: Only the creator of a report can modify or delete it. This ensures accountability and traceability.\n\n3. **Report Format Rule**: Reports must adhere to specific format requirements based on the type of report being generated (e.g., financial reports must include certain fields).\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe domain layer for the `Application/ssrs` aggregate would typically include entities like `Report` and `User`, value objects such as `ReportContent` and `ReportMetadata`, and domain services like `ReportGenerationService`. It would also encapsulate essential business rules governing the creation, modification, and management of reports. This structured approach ensures that the domain logic remains cohesive, maintainable, and aligned with the business requirements. If the domain layer is not present, it is crucial to establish these components to effectively manage the business logic and maintain the integrity of the application.')
