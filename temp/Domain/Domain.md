AgentRunResult(output="### Domain Layer Documentation\n\nThe domain layer is a crucial component of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), encapsulating the core business logic and rules of the application. It is where the domain model resides, consisting of entities, value objects, domain services, and business rules. Below is a concise analysis of what typically exists in a domain layer, as well as the expected components based on the provided aggregate path.\n\n#### 1. Entities\nEntities are objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. They are defined by their attributes and behaviors. In a typical domain layer, you would find:\n\n- **Identity**: Each entity should have a unique identifier (e.g., `Id` property).\n- **Lifecycle**: Entities often have a lifecycle that includes creation, modification, and deletion.\n- **Behavior**: Entities encapsulate business logic relevant to their state and can enforce invariants.\n\nFor example, if the aggregate pertains to a `Customer`, the `Customer` entity would include properties like `Name`, `Email`, and methods for updating contact information.\n\n#### 2. Value Objects\nValue objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes rather than a unique identity. They represent descriptive aspects of the domain. In the domain layer, you might find:\n\n- **Immutability**: Value objects should not change after creation.\n- **Equality**: Two value objects are considered equal if their properties are equal.\n- **Behavior**: They may contain methods that operate on their properties.\n\nAn example could be an `Address` value object, which includes properties like `Street`, `City`, and `ZipCode`. The `Address` would be treated as equal if all its properties match, regardless of its instance.\n\n#### 3. Domain Services\nDomain services are used to encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object. They are stateless and can coordinate actions between multiple entities or value objects. In the domain layer, you would typically see:\n\n- **Business Logic**: Services that implement complex business rules or processes.\n- **Transaction Management**: Coordination of operations that may involve multiple aggregates.\n\nFor instance, a `PaymentService` might handle the logic for processing payments, ensuring that the necessary validations and transactions are performed.\n\n#### 4. Business Rules\nBusiness rules govern the constraints and policies of the domain. They ensure that the system behaves in a way that aligns with business requirements. In the domain layer, you would typically find:\n\n- **Invariants**: Conditions that must always hold true for the system to be in a valid state.\n- **Validation Logic**: Rules that validate the state of entities and value objects before they are persisted.\n\nFor example, a business rule might dictate that a `Customer` cannot have more than one active subscription at a time.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe domain layer is essential for encapsulating the business logic of an application. It consists of entities, value objects, domain services, and business rules that work together to model the domain effectively. If the provided aggregate does not contain a domain layer, it is critical to design one that accurately reflects the business requirements and ensures the integrity of the domain model. This layer should be cohesive, focusing on the core business logic while maintaining separation from infrastructure concerns.")
