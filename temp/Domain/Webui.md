AgentRunResult(output='### Web UI Layer Documentation for Domain Aggregate\n\n#### Overview\nThe Web UI layer serves as the interface between users and the underlying domain model. It is responsible for handling user interactions, presenting data, and facilitating communication with the backend services through controllers, views, and API endpoints. In the context of the Domain aggregate, the Web UI layer should provide a seamless user experience while adhering to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).\n\n#### Controllers\nControllers in the Web UI layer act as intermediaries between user inputs and the domain logic. They handle HTTP requests, invoke domain services, and return appropriate responses. For the Domain aggregate, the following controller functionalities should be implemented:\n\n- **CRUD Operations**: Controllers should provide endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the Domain aggregate. Each operation should correspond to a specific HTTP method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).\n  \n- **Validation**: Input validation should be performed within the controllers to ensure that user inputs conform to the business rules defined in the domain model.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Controllers should gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user, ensuring a robust user experience.\n\n- **Authentication and Authorization**: Controllers should enforce security measures to protect sensitive operations, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.\n\n#### Views\nViews in the Web UI layer are responsible for rendering the user interface. They should be designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. Key aspects of the views for the Domain aggregate include:\n\n- **Data Presentation**: Views should present data from the Domain aggregate in a clear and organized manner. This includes lists, tables, and detail views that allow users to easily navigate and understand the information.\n\n- **Forms**: Forms should be provided for user input, such as creating or updating entities within the Domain aggregate. These forms should include appropriate input types, validation messages, and user guidance.\n\n- **Responsive Design**: The views should be responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.\n\n- **User Feedback**: Incorporate notifications, alerts, and confirmations to provide feedback on user actions, such as successful submissions or errors.\n\n#### API Endpoints\nThe Web UI layer should expose a set of API endpoints that allow for interaction with the Domain aggregate. These endpoints should be RESTful and follow standard conventions:\n\n- **GET /api/domain**: Retrieve a list of Domain entities.\n- **GET /api/domain/{id}**: Retrieve a specific Domain entity by its ID.\n- **POST /api/domain**: Create a new Domain entity.\n- **PUT /api/domain/{id}**: Update an existing Domain entity.\n- **DELETE /api/domain/{id}**: Delete a Domain entity.\n\nThese endpoints should support JSON format for data exchange and implement appropriate status codes for responses.\n\n#### User Interfaces\nThe user interfaces should be designed with user experience in mind, focusing on usability and accessibility. Considerations include:\n\n- **Navigation**: Clear and intuitive navigation to allow users to easily find and access different parts of the application.\n\n- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the UI complies with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities.\n\n- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all views and components to enhance user familiarity and comfort.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Web UI layer for the Domain aggregate is crucial for providing a user-friendly interface that interacts effectively with the domain model. By implementing well-structured controllers, intuitive views, robust API endpoints, and thoughtful user interfaces, the application can deliver a seamless experience that aligns with DDD principles. If a Web UI layer does not currently exist, it is essential to develop these components to facilitate user interaction and enhance the overall functionality of the application.')
