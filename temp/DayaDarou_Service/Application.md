AgentRunResult(output="### Application Layer Documentation for DayaDarou/Service Aggregate\n\nThe application layer serves as a bridge between the domain model and the external world, orchestrating the flow of data and the execution of business logic. In the context of the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, the application layer is responsible for handling commands, queries, and the interaction with the domain layer through application services, command handlers, query handlers, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Application Layer\n\n1. **Application Services**:\n   - Application services encapsulate the use cases of the application. They orchestrate the interaction between the domain model and the external systems (like user interfaces or external APIs).\n   - For the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, application services would typically include methods to create, update, delete, or retrieve service-related data. They ensure that the necessary domain logic is executed and that the integrity of the aggregate is maintained.\n\n2. **Command Handlers**:\n   - Command handlers are responsible for processing commands that modify the state of the application. Each command corresponds to a specific action that the user or system wants to perform.\n   - In the context of the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, command handlers would handle commands such as `CreateServiceCommand`, `UpdateServiceCommand`, or `DeleteServiceCommand`. These handlers would validate the commands, invoke the appropriate methods on the domain model, and manage transactions.\n\n3. **Query Handlers**:\n   - Query handlers are responsible for retrieving data from the system without modifying its state. They respond to queries that request information about the aggregate.\n   - For the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, query handlers would handle queries like `GetServiceByIdQuery` or `ListAllServicesQuery`. These handlers would interact with repositories to fetch data and return it in a format suitable for the presentation layer.\n\n4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:\n   - DTOs are simple objects that carry data between processes. They are used to transfer data between the application layer and the presentation layer or other external systems.\n   - In the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, DTOs would be defined to represent the data structure for service-related information. For instance, `ServiceDTO` might include properties such as `Id`, `Name`, `Description`, and `Price`. DTOs help decouple the internal domain model from external representations, ensuring that changes in the domain do not directly impact the presentation layer.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe application layer of the DayaDarou/Service aggregate plays a crucial role in managing the application's use cases, enforcing business rules, and ensuring data integrity. By organizing responsibilities into application services, command handlers, query handlers, and DTOs, the application layer promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and evolve. If the application layer does not currently exist in the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, it is recommended to implement it to enhance the overall architecture and facilitate better interaction with the domain model.")
