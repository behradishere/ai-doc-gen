AgentRunResult(output='### Web UI Layer Documentation for DayaDarou/Service Aggregate\n\n#### Overview\nThe Web UI layer serves as the interface between users and the underlying domain model encapsulated within the DayaDarou/Service aggregate. This layer typically includes controllers, views, API endpoints, and user interfaces that facilitate user interactions with the application.\n\n#### Controllers\nControllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing user input, and returning appropriate responses. In the context of the DayaDarou/Service aggregate, the following controller functionalities would typically be present:\n\n1. **ServiceController**: This controller would manage CRUD operations for the Service aggregate. It would include methods such as:\n   - `GetAllServices()`: Retrieves a list of all services.\n   - `GetServiceById(int id)`: Fetches a specific service by its ID.\n   - `CreateService(ServiceDto serviceDto)`: Handles the creation of a new service.\n   - `UpdateService(int id, ServiceDto serviceDto)`: Updates an existing service.\n   - `DeleteService(int id)`: Deletes a service by its ID.\n\n2. **Validation**: Each action method should include validation logic to ensure that the data received from the user is valid before processing.\n\n#### Views\nViews are responsible for rendering the user interface. In a typical ASP.NET MVC application, views for the DayaDarou/Service aggregate might include:\n\n1. **Index.cshtml**: Displays a list of all services with options to create, edit, or delete services.\n2. **Create.cshtml**: A form for creating a new service, including fields for all necessary attributes.\n3. **Edit.cshtml**: A form for editing an existing service, pre-populated with the current service data.\n4. **Details.cshtml**: Displays detailed information about a specific service.\n\n#### API Endpoints\nIf the DayaDarou/Service aggregate exposes a RESTful API, the following endpoints would typically be defined:\n\n- `GET /api/services`: Retrieves all services.\n- `GET /api/services/{id}`: Retrieves a specific service by ID.\n- `POST /api/services`: Creates a new service.\n- `PUT /api/services/{id}`: Updates an existing service.\n- `DELETE /api/services/{id}`: Deletes a service.\n\nThese endpoints would return JSON responses, allowing for seamless integration with front-end frameworks or mobile applications.\n\n#### User Interfaces\nThe user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to interact with the service aggregate effectively. Key UI components might include:\n\n1. **Navigation Bar**: Links to different sections of the application, such as service management, user profiles, and settings.\n2. **Forms**: User-friendly forms for creating and editing services, with appropriate input validation and error handling.\n3. **Data Tables**: Displaying lists of services with sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities.\n4. **Modals**: For confirmation dialogs when deleting services or for displaying additional information without navigating away from the current page.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Web UI layer for the DayaDarou/Service aggregate is crucial for enabling user interactions with the domain model. It encompasses controllers that handle requests, views that render the UI, API endpoints for external access, and user interfaces designed for ease of use. If this layer is not currently implemented, it is essential to develop these components to enhance user experience and facilitate effective service management.')
