The initial version (1.0.0) laid the foundation by defining the aggregate root and its properties, allowing for basic application submissions. As the application evolved, several key features were introduced to enhance functionality and user experience.\n\nIn version 1.1.0, the aggregate was enhanced with status tracking capabilities, allowing users to monitor the progress of their applications. This was complemented by the implementation of event sourcing, which provided a robust mechanism for tracking state changes over time.\n\nPerformance improvements were a focus in version 1.2.0, where database queries were optimized, and the codebase was refactored to reduce dependencies between layers. This not only improved the performance of the application but also made the code more maintainable.\n\nSecurity was a significant concern addressed in version 1.3.0, where role-based access control was introduced to safeguard sensitive information. The aggregate underwent a security audit, resulting in the identification and resolution of vulnerabilities.\n\nThe introduction of RESTful API endpoints in version 1.4.0 marked a significant milestone, allowing external systems to interact with the Application aggregate seamlessly. The addition of Swagger documentation facilitated easier integration for developers.\n\nFinally, version 1.5.0 focused on user experience, enhancing the interface for application submission and tracking, and implementing notifications to keep users informed about their application status.\n\nOverall, the changelog reflects a commitment to continuous improvement, addressing user needs, security, and performance while maintaining a clear and organized development history. This structured approach ensures that stakeholders can easily track changes and understand the evolution of the Application aggregate over time.')
