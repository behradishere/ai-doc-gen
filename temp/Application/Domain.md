AgentRunResult(output='### Domain Layer Documentation for the Application Aggregate\n\n#### Overview\nThe domain layer is a crucial component in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that encapsulates the business logic and rules of the application. It consists of entities, value objects, domain services, and aggregates that collectively represent the core of the business domain.\n\n#### Entities\nEntities are objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. In the context of the Application aggregate, entities may include:\n\n- **Application**: This could represent a specific application submitted by a user. It would have a unique identifier (e.g., ApplicationId), and properties such as status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected), submission date, and associated user details.\n\n- **User**: If the application is tied to a user, the User entity would hold information about the individual submitting the application, including their identity, contact information, and roles.\n\nEntities in the Application aggregate should enforce invariants and maintain their own state. For instance, the Application entity might enforce rules such as ensuring that an application cannot be submitted more than once by the same user.\n\n#### Value Objects\nValue objects are immutable types that represent descriptive aspects of the domain. They do not have a unique identity and are defined only by their attributes. In the Application aggregate, potential value objects could include:\n\n- **ApplicationDetails**: This could encapsulate details about the application, such as the type of application, description, and any specific attributes relevant to the application process.\n\n- **Address**: If the application requires an address, this could be a value object that includes street, city, state, and zip code. It would ensure that address-related logic (like validation) is encapsulated within the object.\n\nValue objects should be designed for immutability and should include validation logic to ensure that they are always in a valid state.\n\n#### Domain Services\nDomain services are used to encapsulate domain logic that does not naturally fit within an entity or value object. They can be used for operations that involve multiple entities or complex business rules. In the Application aggregate, a potential domain service could be:\n\n- **ApplicationProcessingService**: This service could handle the logic for processing applications, including validation, approval workflows, and notifications. It would coordinate actions between entities and enforce business rules that govern the application lifecycle.\n\n#### Business Rules\nThe business rules define the constraints and policies that govern the behavior of entities and value objects. In the Application aggregate, some typical business rules might include:\n\n- An application must be submitted with all required details filled out.\n- An application can only be submitted once per user.\n- The status of an application can only be changed by authorized personnel.\n- Notifications must be sent to users upon status changes of their applications.\n\nThese rules should be enforced within the entities and domain services to ensure that the application remains in a valid state throughout its lifecycle.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe domain layer of the Application aggregate serves as the backbone of the business logic, encapsulating entities, value objects, and domain services that work together to enforce business rules. Properly designing this layer is essential for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the application, ensuring that it aligns with the core business requirements. If the domain layer is not present, it is critical to identify and implement these components to achieve a robust and maintainable architecture.')
